Upload one .dat file (pipe-delimited)

Input number of output files (N)

Split based on:

Column 19 (index 18 or 19?) → your code uses column_index = 19, so we’ll keep that

Same column19 value must NOT be split across files

Download multiple output files

Output naming:

sourcefile1.dat
sourcefile2.dat
...


Read all rows

Group rows by column 19 value

Distribute those groups across N files

Ensure:

Same key never goes to different files

Files are roughly balanced

This is exactly how enterprise batch splitting is done.



Streamlit:

Stores the file in memory (RAM)

Exposes it as a file-like object

Deletes it when:

user refreshes

session ends

app restarts

🚫 It is NOT automatically written to disk
🚫 It is NOT persisted anywhere by default
